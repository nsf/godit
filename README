 --== Godit - a very religious text editor ==--

I call it religious, because there is a strong faith in the "one true way"
of doing things. By that I mean things like: "the tab size is always an
equivalent to 8 spaces/characters" or "each line ends with '\n' symbol and
someone should end this '\r\n' madness" or "text files are always utf-8
encoded". Most editors provide customizable options for these things, but
godit takes a different approach in that area and has no settings at all. So,
that concludes the ideology behind godit.

If you're interested in what godit feels like, it would be fair to say that it
is an emacsish lightweight text editor. The godit uses many of the emacs key
bindings and operates using a notion of "micromodes". It's easier to explain
what a micromode is by a simple example. Let's take the keyboard macros feature
from both emacs and godit. You can start recording a macro using `C-x (` key
combination and then when you're ready to start repeating it, you do the
following: `C-x e (e...)`. Not only `C-x e` ends the recording of a macro, it
executes the macro once and enters a micromode, where typing `e` again, will
repeat that action. But as soon as some other key was pressed you quit this
micromode and everything is back to normal again. The idea of micromode is used
in godit a lot.

 --== Current development state==--

I'm still in process of designing some parts of it. Bits of functionality are
missing, but frankly I write godit in godit already and I use godit for
everything else on my system (EDITOR=godit). This README was written in godit
from scratch, I write commit messages in godit, I write code in godit, I write
configs and scripts in godit. The editor is definitely usable, but it is
certain that some corner cases are not covered. Just try it, perhaps you would
like it. Oh and I'm very picky about feature suggestions at the moment,
suggest, but don't expect too much.
